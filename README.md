Hi, Iâ€™m @netmico

ðŸ”§ With a background in network engineering, Iâ€™m now diving into the world of DevOps.

ðŸŒ± For 6 years, Iâ€™ve been mastering Terraform, Docker, Kubenetes, gitlab, github building VPCs on AWS, Azure, and GCP. Cloudflare and DigitalOcean are my go-to tools!

ðŸ’¡ My goal is to share my knowledge, grow with the community, and fuel my passion for network and DevOps.
